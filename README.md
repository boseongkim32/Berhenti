# Berhenti

_Berhenti is an application to help individuals combat addiction by managing triggers and keeping friends accountable._

## Architecture

The entry folder contains the screens that we see when we first set up the app. For example, logging in and signing up is done through the frontScreen.js file.
The navigation folder contains the screens that we see when inside the app, such as PokeView tab, tree_view tab, etc.
The components folder contains components that go into each screen, such as PokeItem.js for individual pokes in the poke tab, and feedItem.js for individual feed items in the feed tab.
The store folder contains all the ways to connect to the backend API.
The styles folder contains all the styling for each page and component.

## Setup

Git clone the repository and then run `npm install`. With an expo account, run `npx expo start`. You can choose to run the simulator by pressing i or scan the QR code with the expo go app installed on the phone to test it out there.
